    <h2 My Current Projects
    <main> </main>  

        Web design- Currently i'm in school learning about web design and this project will be my first official web page I created.
     Writing a novel- Currently i'm working on my first book. A mystery thriller about a young boy and his friends who live in an outskirt small town with a mysterious past and a forest that many have gone missing in.
         Customizing shoes - In my free time I'm working on airbrushing shoes. I want to create some custom painted shoes that others can wear to express themselves. The goal for me here is to recreate anime and cartoon characters and/or settings on wearable shoes.
