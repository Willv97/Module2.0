    <h2>My Current Projects</h2> 
        <header><h3>What Im Working On</h3></header> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Web design- Currently I'm in school learning about web design. In the course I am learning how to code and create webpages using html, css, and javascript. This webpage is for our module 2 project and will be my first official web page that I've created.</li><img src="web design.jpeg"><br> <br>
         <li>Writing a novel- Currently I'm working on my first book. A mystery thriller about a young boy and his friends who live in an outskirt small town with a mysterious past and a forest that many have gone missing in. The thought of getting my own writing out there for others to read is exciting to me. </li> <img src="download.jpeg"> <alt="Person writing a book"</alt> <br>  <br>
         <li>Customizing shoes - In my free time I'm working on handbrushing and airbrushing shoes. I want to create some custom painted shoes that others and myself can wear to express themselves in a way that is very rare. The goal for me here is to recreate anime and cartoon characters and/or settings on wearable shoes. But I will also try other designs such as landscapes and colorways</li><img src="af1.webp"><br><BR> <br>
